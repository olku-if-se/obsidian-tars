# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.7+ with strict mode enabled
**Primary Dependencies**: PNPM 9.x, TURBO 2.x, BIOME 1.x, KNIP 5.x, TSX latest, TSUP 8.x, ESBUILD latest, Obsidian API, various AI provider SDKs
**Storage**: Obsidian's encrypted settings for configuration, file system for notes, monorepo package management
**Testing**: Vitest 2.x for unit tests, custom test framework for Obsidian integration, turbo test orchestration
**Target Platform**: Obsidian plugin (desktop + mobile) with monorepo build system
**Project Type**: Monorepo with multiple TypeScript packages and shared dependencies
**Performance Goals**: 50%+ faster builds with turbo caching, <5s incremental builds, <30s full test suite, responsive UI during streaming responses
**Constraints**: Must work within Obsidian's security sandbox and API limitations, maintain monorepo package boundaries
**Scale/Scope**: Monorepo supporting 10+ AI providers, multiple MCP servers, shared packages, global developer community

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All features MUST pass these constitutional gates:

**Gate 1: Plugin Architecture Excellence**
- Feature integrates cleanly with Obsidian APIs (file cache, editor, suggestions)
- Clear separation between provider logic and Obsidian-specific code
- Self-contained and independently testable implementation

**Gate 2: Provider Abstraction**
- Uses existing `Vendor` interface without modifications (unless explicitly justified)
- No provider-specific logic leaks into core plugin code
- Supports streaming responses with proper AbortController handling

**Gate 3: Test-First Development (TDD)**
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced
- Tests MUST be written before implementation, MUST fail initially
- All provider implementations MUST include contract tests
- Code and branch coverage MUST exceed 85%
- All unit tests MUST include Given/When/Then comments in format `// {GIVEN|WHEN|THEN}: {description}`
- Test comments MUST focus on business value, not implementation details

**Gate 4: Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Works on both desktop and mobile Obsidian clients
- Supports both mouse/keyboard and touch interfaces
- Uses Obsidian's cross-platform file system abstraction

**Gate 5: Performance & Responsiveness**
- UI remains responsive during AI operations
- Uses streaming responses for long operations
- No blocking operations in the main thread

**Gate 6: MCP Integration Capability**
- MCP server integrations follow same abstraction patterns as AI providers
- Clean separation between core plugin logic and MCP server implementations
- MCP functionality is independently testable

**Gate 7: Development Standards & Tooling**
- Uses PNPM for package management and workspaces
- Uses TURBO for build orchestration and caching
- Uses BIOME for linting and formatting (replaces ESLint/Prettier)
- Uses KNIP for dependency analysis
- Uses TSX for TypeScript execution
- Uses TSUP/ESBUILD for bundling
- Follows monorepo architecture requirements

**Gate 8: Security & Privacy**
- API keys stored in Obsidian's encrypted settings
- No sensitive data exposed in logs or error messages
- Content only transmitted to configured AI provider or MCP server
- MCP server connections have appropriate security controls and user consent

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
