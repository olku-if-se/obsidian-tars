# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.5+ with strict mode enabled
**Primary Dependencies**: Obsidian API, esbuild, ESLint, Prettier, various AI provider SDKs
**Storage**: Obsidian's encrypted settings for configuration, file system for notes
**Testing**: Jest/Vitest for unit tests, custom test framework for Obsidian integration
**Target Platform**: Obsidian plugin (desktop + mobile)
**Project Type**: Single TypeScript project with modular provider architecture
**Performance Goals**: Responsive UI during streaming responses, <100ms UI response time
**Constraints**: Must work within Obsidian's security sandbox and API limitations
**Scale/Scope**: Plugin supporting 10+ AI providers, multiple MCP servers, global user base

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All features MUST pass these constitutional gates:

**Gate 1: Plugin Architecture Excellence**
- Feature integrates cleanly with Obsidian APIs (file cache, editor, suggestions)
- Clear separation between provider logic and Obsidian-specific code
- Self-contained and independently testable implementation

**Gate 2: Provider Abstraction**
- Uses existing `Vendor` interface without modifications (unless explicitly justified)
- No provider-specific logic leaks into core plugin code
- Supports streaming responses with proper AbortController handling

**Gate 3: Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Works on both desktop and mobile Obsidian clients
- Supports both mouse/keyboard and touch interfaces
- Uses Obsidian's cross-platform file system abstraction

**Gate 4: Performance & Responsiveness**
- UI remains responsive during AI operations
- Uses streaming responses for long operations
- No blocking operations in the main thread

**Gate 5: MCP Integration Capability**
- MCP server integrations follow same abstraction patterns as AI providers
- Clean separation between core plugin logic and MCP server implementations
- MCP functionality is independently testable

**Gate 6: Security & Privacy**
- API keys stored in Obsidian's encrypted settings
- No sensitive data exposed in logs or error messages
- Content only transmitted to configured AI provider or MCP server
- MCP server connections have appropriate security controls and user consent

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
