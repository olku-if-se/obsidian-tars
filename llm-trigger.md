# Agent: from-code-to-ui-spec

review the code and in text describe what is the layout of the UI that created by this code, code: packages/plugin/src/settings/MCPServerSettings.ts

Goal: produce description that is sufficient to recreate UI in any framework or even TUI

Include in description the layout important rules that this implementation follow, like: 
- which paddings/offset/margins should be used?
- are we keeping the same whitespace from left and right? Are we keeping the same whitespace from top and bottom? Are we following a baseline grid?
- are we using any separators/dividers, like: horizontal lines, gap space or vertical line (border color, line, or spacing multiplier)?
- how controls are aligned in relation to container? anchors to any corner? how it will behave on different screen resolution?
- how controls aligned in relation to each other, are they behave as a group, responsive to container or are absolute in positioning? 
- used Layout understanding principles (be inspired by Material design layout logic, but stay agnostic to Brand): 
  - https://m2.material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html#layout-anatomy
  - https://m2.material.io/design/layout/spacing-methods.html#baseline-grid 
- Should controls start expanded or collapsed, enabled or disabled?
- What are the expected actions on UI interactions: onClick, onHover, etc. ? Try to capture behavior in different logical states.
- Try to be more specific about entity that visualized, example: bad "Add Custom Server Button" vs good: "Add Custom MCP Server Button". 
- Try to identify data entities that used during visualization (like: MCP Server, Global Settings, etc)

review the code and in text describe what is the layout of the UI that created by this code, code: packages/plugin/src/settings/MCPServerSettings.ts


  UI Layout Overview

  The MCPServerSettings class creates a comprehensive settings interface for configuring MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers within Obsidian. The layout is organized into several
  main sections:

  1. Global Settings Section

  At the top, it renders global MCP configuration controls:
  - Global timeout field - Text input for maximum tool execution time (default: 30000ms)
  - Concurrent limit field - Text input for max simultaneous tool executions (default: 3)
  - Session limit field - Text input for max tool executions per session (default: 25, -1 for unlimited)
  - Parallel execution toggle - Toggle switch for enabling concurrent tool execution
  - LLM utility section toggle - Toggle for inserting provider/model info in responses
  - Max parallel tools field - Text input for maximum parallel tools (default: 3)

  2. Server List Section

  Below global settings, it displays configured MCP servers:
  - Empty state message - Shows "No MCP servers configured" when no servers exist
  - Collapsible server sections - Each server is rendered in a <details> element with:
    - Summary bar showing server name and status indicator:
        - Green "✓ Enabled" for active servers
      - Red "✗ Error" for auto-disabled servers
      - Red "✗ Disabled" for manually disabled servers

  3. Individual Server Section Content

  Each server section contains:

  Controls Row (rendered by renderServerControls):
  - Enable/Disable button - Toggles server state with dynamic button text
  - Test button - Tests server connection, shows "Testing..." during execution with success/error notices
  - Delete button - Red warning button to remove the server

  Server Name Input (rendered by renderServerNameInput):
  - Text field for server name with real-time uniqueness validation
  - Shows red border and error message if name duplicates existing server
  - Updates the summary bar name dynamically as you type

  Configuration Section (rendered by renderConfigurationSection):
  - Configuration header with description "Supports 3 formats: Command, Claude JSON, or URL"
  - Format toggle button - Cycles through available formats (Show as URL/Show as command/Show as JSON)
  - Dynamic input area that changes based on format:
    - URL mode: Simple text input with live command preview below
    - Command/JSON mode: Multi-line textarea with monospace font for advanced configuration
  - Real-time validation feedback:
    - Green checkmarks for valid configurations
    - Red error messages with copy-to-clipboard button for errors
    - Format detection messages showing detected type and server name

  4. Quick Add Section

  Pre-configured popular server options:
  - Section header: "Quick Add Popular Servers" with description
  - Exa Search button - Adds pre-configured Exa search server
  - Filesystem Server button - Adds filesystem server with placeholder path

  5. Add Custom Server Section

  Final section with:
  - "Add Custom MCP Server" button - Creates new empty server configuration with unique name

  Interactive Features

  - Real-time validation - All inputs validate immediately with visual feedback
  - Format conversion - Seamless conversion between URL, command, and JSON formats
  - Status synchronization - Server status updates across all UI elements when changed
  - Error handling - Comprehensive error display with helpful tips and clipboard copying
  - Dynamic UI updates - Interface re-renders after adding/removing servers
  - Collapsible sections - Server configurations can be expanded/collapsed for better organization

  The UI follows Obsidian's design patterns using the Setting component class and maintains consistency with the rest of the plugin's settings interface.

  MCPServerSettings UI Layout Description

  Purpose

  The MCPServerSettings class creates a comprehensive settings interface for configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers within the Obsidian plugin settings. It provides both
  global MCP configuration controls and individual server management capabilities.

  Behavior

  - Dynamic server management: Add, remove, enable/disable, and test MCP server connections
  - Real-time validation: Immediate feedback on configuration inputs with error handling
  - Format conversion: Seamless switching between URL, command, and JSON configuration formats
  - Status synchronization: Live updates of server connection status across all UI elements
  - Collapsible organization: Server configurations can be expanded/collapsed for better space management

  Description

  The UI renders a hierarchical settings interface composed of five main sections:

  1. Global Settings - Universal MCP configuration controls
  2. Server List - Collapsible sections for each configured MCP server
  3. Individual Server Controls - Per-server management interface
  4. Quick Add Section - Pre-configured popular server templates
  5. Custom Server Addition - Manual server creation capability

  Layout Behavior

  Positioning & Container Structure

  - Flow-based layout: Uses standard document flow (no absolute positioning)
  - Responsive to container: All elements are block or flex and adapt to container width
  - Hierarchical nesting: Settings contain nested containers with proper semantic structure

  Spacing System (CSS Custom Properties)

  - Vertical spacing: Consistent use of var(--size-4-2) (8px) and var(--size-4-3) (12px) margins
  - Component spacing: var(--size-4-4) (16px) between major sections
  - Tight spacing: var(--size-2-2) (4px) for related elements within components
  - Error spacing: margin-top: var(--size-2-2) for error messages below inputs

  Control Alignment & Grouping

  - Button groups: Controls aligned horizontally using display: flex with consistent gaps
  - Control button sizing: Uniform min-width: 80px; height: 32px for visual consistency
  - Text inputs: Full width (width: 100%) with box-sizing: border-box
  - Label alignment: Standard Obsidian Setting component alignment patterns

  Visual Hierarchy

  - Collapsible sections: <details> elements with styled summary headers (48px min-height)
  - Status indicators: 8px left margin for status text with color coding
  - Typography hierarchy: Uses Obsidian's font scale (--font-ui-medium, --font-ui-small, --font-ui-smaller)
  - Interactive feedback: Hover states and focus indicators with smooth transitions

  Input Layout Patterns

  - Form controls: Follow Obsidian's Setting component layout (label on left, control on right)
  - Validation feedback: Inline error messages with red borders and text
  - Dynamic content areas: Conditional visibility based on format selection (URL vs command vs JSON)
  - Monospace formatting: Code inputs use var(--font-monospace) with 13px font size

  Responsive Behavior

  - Full-width elements: All inputs and buttons expand to fill available space
  - Flexible text areas: Vertical resize (resize: vertical) with min-height: 150px
  - Adaptive button layouts: Button groups wrap if container is too narrow
  - Scrollable content: Overflow areas use overflow-y: auto with max-height constraints

  State-Driven Styling

  - Status colors: Dynamic color classes (mcp-status-enabled, mcp-status-disabled, mcp-status-error)
  - Interactive states: Hover, focus, and disabled states following Obsidian theme variables
  - Validation states: Border color changes (var(--text-error)) for invalid inputs
  - Loading states: Button text changes and disabled states during operations

  The layout strictly follows Obsidian's design system using CSS custom properties for consistent spacing, typography, and theming while maintaining accessibility and responsive
  behavior across different screen sizes and theme variations.

investigate i18n implemntation in our project, start point: `packages/plugin/src/lang`

propose a proper several steps migration process to a real i18n.

compose plan markdown document: `docs/{timestamp}-i18n-migration.md`

Expectations:
- migration will happens in several releases
- we need to prepare project for propert i18n, like externalize string and use some kind of simple wrappers/tools/npm-libs that help to make next steps even simpler
- propose a way to structure texts, so it is easy to translate them and community can be involved for providing extra translations (or AI can help with a translations)

I'm refactoring/migrating packages/plugin/src/settingTab.ts to packages/ui/src/views/SettingsTab/SettingsTab.tsx

help me to achieve the same layout of the elements, focus only on layout. No theme colors or else is required. I provde the screenshot of old UI that I want to migrate to React. So I assume to see a break down of UI, to multiple UI smaller components according to packages/ui/ARCHITECTURE.md .

I will provide extra screenshots (with open collapsed sections) when you are ready.

---

read documents `docs/2025-10-12-{review|planning|tasks|changelog|migration-guide|test-strategy}.md`

read our current plan `docs/2025-10-13-react-migration-plan.md`

read `packages/ui/ARCHITECTURE.md`

the big shift in plan is - no need to use a feature flags, we will release a major version upgrade, so will be no granular replacement of UI.

remove feature flags from settings.

update `docs/2025-10-13-react-migration-plan.md`, reflect current `packages/ui` structure in plan and `packages/ui/ARCHITECTURE.md` documents.


ok, now we are ready for implementing next step from react migration plan. I mean Settings. 
---

read documents `docs/2025-10-12-{review|planning|tasks|changelog|migration-guide|test-strategy}.md` 

we also have a trello board which should be updated with the progress of the tasks in addition to the documents. Use trello mcp for that.
use `docs/trello-workflow-guide.md` as instructions for trello board.

check which task we should solve next

---

read documents `docs/2025-10-12-{review|planning|tasks|changelog|migration-guide|test-strategy}.md`

continue implementation of the tasks from document @docs/2025-10-03-120627-tasks.md 

tasks are based on:
- @docs/2025-10-03-mcp-integration-review.md - initial review, that already modified by several commit. so examine the git commit messages to capture the updates
- @docs/2025-10-03-115553-planning.md - break down to tasks
- @docs/2025-10-03-planning-v2.md - alternative version of the plan with more acceptance criterias
- @docs/2025-10-07-075907-tasks-trimmed.md - shorter version of the tasks

start working on the next task from the list, keep attention to Important Notes from documents.
each task should be finished with build and full tests re-run, after that should be prepared git commit command with multiline semantic commit message.


so far we achieve minimalistic working version of the plugin, I see in Obsidian app that we successfully can execute the tools with Ollama provider. We are close to significant milestone - "release candidate"

```memory-server
tool:create_entities
entities:
  - name: language_learning_curve
    entityType: concept
    observations:
      - JavaScript: gentle
      - TypeScript: moderate
      - Python: gentle
      - Java: moderate
      - C++: steep
```


Tasks:
- session limit requires for MCP server should be applyied in context of one obsidian document. Switching between documents should reset the session limit.
- session limit should be resetable by user to zero, we should we raise a notification to user to reset the counter. "Continue" button.
- mcp server tool execution should be smart and not executed second time if we already have the results in the document. We should show notification to user to execute the tool again. "Re-execute" button.
- In settings "MCP Servers" section by default should be closed. If user did any changes then we should keep the state of the section is it expanded or collapsed.
- In settings "System message" section should be expandable/collabsable.
- In settings "Show as command" make sence in pairs: JSON-to-ShellCommand and URL-to-ShellCommand. JSON-to-URL is not possible by default, exception is only JSON that correspond our auto-generated for URLs mcp-remote configuration.
- Refresh button in Status Bar modl dialog, should reload MCP servers, create a new session and reset the session limit. 
- Current count of Session limit should be visible in status bar modal dialog.
- Refresh button should first kill all existing sessions, and MCP servers. Status should be clearly visible in status bar modal dialog. Make a small delay between killing and recreation of MCP servers. servers icons should correctly display the status.
- On tool selecting from the drop-down expected auto-generation of parametes for tool calling and placing this in the document.
- Tool execution title does not contain a space between words: `Duration: 7msType: json` should be `Duration: 7ms, Type: json`.
- Tool execution by LLM and manual way are different in formatting in document, but expected that they should be identical. User should be able to copy tool execution from history and copy/paste it to another document, and tool will be reexecuted (if no results of tool is available yet, otherwise can use cached value).
- We need an "utility section" that tracks which tools we register in LLM during the prompt/session. This section should become a part of the obsidian document. Also we should be able to enable/disable this behavior via global settings. 
- We need to register commands for each MCP server, on command execution we should creat in current cursor position section that triggers the tool execution with parameters.

## Tasks 2025-10-10

- extract MCP servers hosting logic into own monorepo package. It should be library that taking care of running MCP servers, executing specific tools, etc. Think deeper what can we include into this library (refactor existing code).
- Make Provider Controls section with buttons: Test and Remove.
- Change MCP Server controls section button "Delete" text to "Remove".
- 

## Commit Message Sample:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: add Epic-1000 for LLM provider connection testing

Add new stabilization epic to improve AI provider configuration UX with
connection testing capabilities.

**Epic-1000: Stabilization & Quality Improvements (8 SP)**

**Feature-1000-10: LLM Provider Connection Testing (5 SP)**
- Task-1000-10-5-1: Create provider test connection utility with two-tier strategy
  - Primary: Request available models list (works for most providers)
  - Fallback: Send minimal ping/echo/hello message with streaming disabled
  - Returns success/failure with helpful error messages and latency
  
- Task-1000-10-5-2: Add test button to provider settings UI
  - Similar to MCP server test button pattern
  - Clear visual feedback for success/failure
  - Loading state during test execution
  
- Task-1000-10-5-3: Add provider-specific test implementations
  - OpenAI/compatible: Use /v1/models endpoint
  - Claude: Use minimal message with max_tokens: 1
  - Ollama: Use /api/tags endpoint
  - Others: Default to echo strategy
  
- Task-1000-10-5-4: Add connection test unit tests
  - Mock HTTP responses and verify fallback behavior

**Rationale:**
Users requested a way to validate AI provider credentials and connection
before attempting to use them, similar to the MCP server test functionality.
This will help diagnose configuration issues early and provide clearer
feedback about connectivity problems.

**Files Modified:**
- docs/2025-10-07-075907-tasks-trimmed.md: Add Epic-1000 and tasks
