# Feature Specification: Monorepo Migration with Modern Tooling

**Feature Branch**: `002-migrate-to-monorepo-structure`
**Created**: 2025-01-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Migrate current project to the monorepo structure, use pnpm, turbo, tsup, latest SDK"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-24
- Q: Migration Strategy and Rollback Plan → A: Big bang migration - all users switch at once with no fallback
- Q: User Data Migration → A: Nothing, we are not changing any user data at this point
- Q: Package Versioning Strategy → A: Single version number for all packages with semantic commit messages
- Q: CI/CD Pipeline Integration → A: Update CI/CD to use turbo for optimized builds, expected adoption to the change of the build destination folders
- Q: Performance Baseline Establishment → A: Not required for today state of project
- Q: Multi-target build requirements → A: Plugin bundled JS, all other packages ESM only, testing - ESM
- Q: Code coverage requirements → A: All new code - should be 85%+ covered by tests
- Q: Single version management implementation → A: Skip for now
- Q: TSX execution requirements → A: CLI tools, demo scripts, and development utilities need TSX execution

### Session 2025-10-27 - Scope Clarification
**Scope Boundary Definition**:
The monorepo migration scope is **explicitly bounded to infrastructure setup only**, excluding code refactoring and feature development which belong to separate specifications.

**Infrastructure-Only Scope Includes**:
- Build tool setup and configuration (pnpm, turbo, tsup, biome, knip, vitest)
- Workspace configuration and dependency management
- Development workflow automation and optimization
- Build performance optimization and caching
- Quality gate setup and validation

**Explicitly Excluded from This Scope**:
- Code refactoring between packages (separate specification needed)
- Moving existing code to different packages (separate specification needed)
- Implementation of new CLI tools (separate specification needed)
- Adding new AI providers or features (separate specification needed)
- Testing infrastructure expansion (separate specification needed)

**Rationale**:
- Infrastructure migration can be completed independently of code organization
- Separates concerns between build system setup and application development
- Allows for focused, manageable implementation phases
- Prevents scope creep and ensures clear project boundaries

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Seamless Migration Experience (Priority: P1)

Users should experience no disruption during the migration from the current single-package structure to the new monorepo structure. All existing functionality must continue to work exactly as before.

**Why this priority**: This is critical - any disruption to existing users would be unacceptable for a migration effort.

**Independent Test**: Users can install the migrated plugin and all existing features (tag commands, AI providers, settings, etc.) work identically to the previous version.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the migration is complete, **When** a user installs the plugin, **Then** all existing AI providers work without configuration changes
2. **Given** the new structure, **When** a user uses tag commands, **Then** behavior is identical to pre-migration
3. **Given** development environment, **When** a developer runs build commands, **Then** build succeeds and produces functional plugin
4. **Given** big bang migration approach, **When** users update plugin, **Then** no fallback mechanism is provided

---

### User Story 2 - Enhanced Developer Experience (Priority: P1)

Developers should benefit from improved build performance, better dependency management, and modern tooling in the monorepo structure.

**Why this priority**: Better developer experience leads to faster iteration and higher quality contributions.

**Independent Test**: Developers can set up the project from scratch using new tooling and build/test all packages successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new monorepo structure, **When** a developer runs `pnpm install`, **Then** all dependencies are installed correctly for all packages
2. **Given** the monorepo, **When** a developer runs `turbo run build`, **Then** all packages build efficiently with proper caching
3. **Given** development mode, **When** changes are made, **Then** hot reloading works correctly with fast rebuilds
4. **Given** test suite, **When** `turbo run test` is executed, **Then** all tests run in parallel and pass

---

### User Story 3 - Extensible Package Architecture (Priority: P2)

The monorepo should enable clear separation of concerns between different parts of the codebase while maintaining proper inter-package dependencies.

**Why this priority**: Enables future growth and maintenance of the increasingly complex codebase.

**Independent Test**: Each package can be developed, tested, and built independently while maintaining proper integration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** package structure, **When** changes are made to providers package, **Then** only affected packages need rebuilding
2. **Given** multiple packages, **When** a new AI provider is added, **Then** it only affects the providers package and core integration
3. **Given** separate packages, **When** dependencies are updated, **Then** impact is scoped to relevant packages only

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST migrate from current single package to monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- **FR-002**: System MUST use turbo for build orchestration and caching
- **FR-003**: System MUST use tsup for bundling TypeScript packages with modern configuration
- **FR-004**: System MUST upgrade to latest stable Obsidian SDK and all other dependencies
- **FR-005**: All existing functionality MUST work identically after migration with no user data changes
- **FR-006**: Build performance MUST improve significantly (target: 50%+ faster builds)
- **FR-007**: Development experience MUST support hot reloading and fast iteration with TSX executable CLI tools
- **FR-008**: Package boundaries MUST be clear with proper dependency management
- **FR-009**: All tests MUST pass in the new structure with proper test isolation
- **FR-010**: Monorepo MUST support multiple build targets - plugin bundle (IIFE), ESM packages for development/testing
- **FR-011**: All packages MUST use single version number managed through semantic commit messages
- **FR-012**: CI/CD pipelines MUST be updated to use turbo with new build destination folders

### Key Entities

- **Core Package**: Main plugin logic and Obsidian integration
- **Providers Package**: AI provider implementations and interfaces
- **MCP Package**: MCP server integration logic
- **Shared Package**: Common utilities, types, and interfaces
- **Types Package**: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces
- **Testing Package**: Shared testing utilities and mocks

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*
