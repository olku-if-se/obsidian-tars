## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order**:
1. **Phase 1** (Setup) → **Phase 2** (Foundation) → **Phase 3** (Core Migration) → **Phase 5** (Documentation) → **Phase 6** (Final Validation)

**Critical Path Dependencies**:
- T001-T007 (Setup) must complete before any other work
- T008-T017 (Foundation) must complete before any package work
- Phase 3 (Core Migration) must complete before documentation
- Phase 4 (Optional) can be done in parallel with other phases
- Phase 5 (Documentation) requires completion of core migration

## Parallel Execution Examples

**Phase 3 (Core Migration) - Parallel Groups**:
- **Group A**: T055-T058 (Types package extraction)
- **Group B**: T059-T064 (Shared package extraction)
- **Group C**: T065-T070 (Core package extraction)
- **Group D**: T071-T076 (Providers package extraction)
- **Group E**: T077-T081 (MCP package extraction)
- **Group F**: T087-T092 (Plugin migration)

## Implementation Strategy

**Core Scope (Phase 1-3)**:
- Complete monorepo structure with all packages
- Plugin functionality identical to pre-migration
- Basic build system with Turbo and tsup
- Essential CLI tools for development

**MVP Delivery**:
- **Sprint 1**: Setup + Foundation + Package skeleton (T001-T054)
- **Sprint 2**: Code migration and plugin functionality (T055-T092)
- **Sprint 3**: Documentation and final validation (T101-T103)

**Quality Gates**:
- Each package must compile without warnings/errors
- All packages must pass TypeScript checks
- All packages must pass Biome formatting/lint
- All packages must pass Knip dependency analysis
- All tests must pass (passWithNoTests enabled)
- Plugin bundle must work identically to pre-migration

## Success Criteria Validation

The core migration is complete when:
- **Core Functionality**: Plugin functionality works identically to pre-migration (T092)
- **Build System**: All packages build successfully with turbo (validated)
- **Test System**: All packages can run tests in parallel (validated)
- **Documentation**: Clear setup guide for future development (T101-T102)
- **Final Validation**: Complete system integration test (T103)
