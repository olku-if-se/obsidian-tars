## Parallel Execution Groups

### Group 1 (Foundation Setup)
Tasks: 102, 107, 108, 115, 116, 204, 214, 215
Can be executed in parallel after Task 103 is complete

Note: Task 102.5 (ESLint/Prettier removal) must be completed before any Biome-dependent tasks

### Group 2 (Quality Integration)
Tasks: 118, 120, 206, 207, 209, 210, 212, 301, 302
Can be executed in parallel after Task 119 is complete

### Group 3 (Developer Experience)
Tasks: 203, 208, 305, 306, 307, 308
Can be executed in parallel after Task 202 is complete

## Success Criteria Validation

Each task includes implicit validation criteria:
- ✅ Task completes without errors
- ✅ All quality gates pass (compilation, type-check, biome, knip)
- ✅ Tests pass with minimum 80% coverage
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Performance meets or exceeds targets
- ✅ Documentation is updated and accurate

## Risk Mitigation Tasks

**High-Risk Mitigation**:
- Task 102: Backup and rollback capability
- Task 121: Comprehensive functionality testing
- Task 122: Performance validation against baseline

**Medium-Risk Mitigation**:
- Task 102.5: ESLint/Prettier to Biome migration (rule equivalence)
- Task 117: Biome configuration and migration
- Task 118: Knip dependency analysis setup
- Task 301: Package boundary enforcement

## Quality Gates

Every task must pass these quality gates before completion:
1. **Compilation**: `tsc` completes without warnings/errors
2. **TypeScript**: Strict type checking passes
3. **Biome**: Code formatting and linting passes
4. **Knip**: No unused dependencies or exports
5. **Tests**: All tests pass with minimum coverage
6. **Build**: Package builds successfully in correct format

## Rollback Criteria

If any of these criteria are met, rollback to pre-migration state:
- Plugin functionality is compromised
- Build performance degrades significantly (>20% slower)
- Quality gates cannot be satisfied
- Critical dependencies break
- Cross-platform compatibility is lost
