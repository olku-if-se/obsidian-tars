# Specification Quality Checklist: Needle DI Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **Pass**: The specification focuses on WHAT developers and users need (testability, extensibility, backward compatibility) and WHY (enable TDD, reduce coupling, improve maintainability). While Needle DI is mentioned, it's treated as a solution choice rather than implementation detail.

✅ **Pass**: All content focuses on user value - developers can test in isolation, users get configuration updates without restart, maintainers can add providers safely.

✅ **Pass**: Written for stakeholders - no code examples, no technical jargon beyond necessary domain terms, focus on capabilities and outcomes.

✅ **Pass**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete with substantial content.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **Pass**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are concrete.

✅ **Pass**: Every functional requirement is testable:
- FR-001: Can verify container exists and manages components
- FR-002: Can verify components receive injected dependencies
- FR-003: Can verify tokens provide type-safe access
- FR-004: Can verify mocks work in tests
- And so on for all 20 requirements

✅ **Pass**: All success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "under 5 lines of test setup code" (measurable)
- SC-002: "fewer than 10 lines of registration code" (measurable)
- SC-003: "100% of existing functionality" (measurable)
- SC-004: "no more than 50 milliseconds" (measurable)
- And so on for all 10 criteria

✅ **Pass**: Success criteria avoid implementation details:
- Focus on developer/user outcomes (test setup time, registration complexity)
- Measure performance impact without specifying how it's achieved
- Define outcomes without prescribing technical solutions

✅ **Pass**: 5 user stories each have 2-3 acceptance scenarios defining Given/When/Then conditions.

✅ **Pass**: 6 edge cases identified covering failure scenarios, concurrent operations, and migration concerns.

✅ **Pass**: Clear scope with:
- In scope: DI container, provider migration, backward compatibility
- Out of scope: New providers, performance optimization, end-user docs

✅ **Pass**: Dependencies section lists 6 technical dependencies, Assumptions section lists 9 assumptions about the environment.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Pass**: All 20 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories or can be verified through testing.

✅ **Pass**: 5 user stories cover:
- Testing in isolation (P1)
- Adding new providers (P1)
- Configuration updates (P2)
- Backward compatibility (P1)
- Error handling (P3)

✅ **Pass**: Success criteria define measurable outcomes that align with feature goals:
- Reduced coupling through easier provider addition (SC-002)
- Improved testability through simple test setup (SC-001, SC-005, SC-009)
- Zero breaking changes (SC-003)
- Acceptable performance impact (SC-004, SC-008)

✅ **Pass**: Specification remains at the requirements level. No mention of specific classes, methods, or code structure. Even when naming entities, they're described functionally rather than technically.

## Notes

All checklist items passed on first validation. The specification is ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Key strengths**:
- Clear prioritization with P1 items focusing on core capabilities
- Comprehensive success criteria with specific, measurable outcomes
- Well-defined scope with explicit out-of-scope items
- User stories are independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios
- No implementation details leak into requirements or success criteria
